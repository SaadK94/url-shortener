## Backend Server for Url Shortener

The only dependency for the backend is MongoDB, to run locally you will need a MongoDB server running,
else the application will not start.

Make sure to run `npm i` before you start the application.

Start the dev server with:
```sh
$ npm run start:dev
```
You'll be able to access the server at http://localhost:3000
